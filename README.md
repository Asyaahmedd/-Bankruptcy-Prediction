#  Bankruptcy Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a company going bankrupt using data collected by a team of Polish economists. The goal of this project is to build a robust predictive model that can effectively classify companies as either financially stable or at risk of bankruptcy.

## Introduction
In the realm of finance, predicting bankruptcy is crucial for investors, creditors, and stakeholders to make informed decisions. This project delves into the analysis and prediction of bankruptcy using machine learning techniques. By exploring the provided dataset and implementing predictive models, we aim to provide insights into the factors contributing to bankruptcy and create a reliable predictive tool.
